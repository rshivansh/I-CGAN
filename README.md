# I-CGAN
Torch implementation of Invertible -Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks on Celeb-A dataset . This is the implementation of the [IcGAN model proposed paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06355) .

The baseline used is the [Torch implementation](https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch) of the [DCGAN by Radford et al](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434).

We will be training the model on Celeb A dataset .

You can also find the tensorflow implementation of IcGan here .
